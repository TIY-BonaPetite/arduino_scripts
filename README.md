#Bona Petite Hardware Instructions

Bona Petite is a play on words meaning “a little good”. And that’s what we hope to accomplish with our program. We’re building a computer system that monitors an environment to ensure optimal conditions for growth. This concept is designed with hydroponics in mind, but can easily be integrated into other environments. The sensor hardware in use is managed by specialized C/C++ scripts designed for Arduino micro-controllers. A RaspberryPi computer, using a custom Python script, acts as a bridge between our micro-controller and a web database deployed with Heroku.

Within this repository you will find all of the C scripts used in development, the bridge program run by the Raspberry Pi, the bill of materials for the project, and the electronics schematics images.
